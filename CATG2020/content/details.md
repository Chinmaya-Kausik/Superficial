### Registering for the course

To register for the course, in addition to registering in the IISc system, you need to carry out some steps which will be explained in the first meeting. In case you are familiar with `git` and `markdown`, these are


1. have/create an account in github,
2. fork the repository https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/Superficial,
3. send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to add a file in the `contributions` folder on this repository whose name is your name in [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) with extension `md`, for example  `SiddharthaGadgil.md` and whose contents are in the same format as the example below (__note:__ there should be __no__  blank line at the top).

    ```markdown
    ---
    author: "Siddhartha Gadgil"
    github-id: "siddhartha-gadgil"
    ---
    ```

##### Timings and Venues

The official timings are for now Tuesday and Thursday 9:00 - 10:00 in LH-3, __but they may change__. 

As this is a `1:3` credit course, we will meet an average of 1 hour a week. Initially we will meet more often. As the projectors in the Department are in bad shape, the venue may have to be shifted.

The first meeting will be in LH-3 either on Tuesday, January 7, 2020 or Wednesday, January 8, 2020. Subsequent meetings will be co-ordinated through the outlook e-mail group `CATG2020`.
