# Arka Ghosh

# `TwoComplex.scala`

### `allCollapsed` - Extended definition to give forward and backward maps along with the surface with one vertex.

### `collapseEdge` -  Extended definition to give forward and backward maps along with the surface with one vertex.

### `succOpt` - Defined this method which gives the succesor of an edge if possible.

### `predOpt` - Defined this method which gives the predecessor of an edge if possible.

### `rotateLeftOpt` - Defined this method which gives the result of rotating an edge by left once when such rotation is possible.

### `rotateRightOpt` - Defined this method which gives the result of rotating an edge by right once when such rotation is possible.

### `allEdgesToTheLeftOf` - Defined this method which gives all edges to the left of the given edge.

### `allEdgesToTheRightOf` - Defined this method which gives all edges to the right of the given edge.

### `edgesEndingAt` - Defined this method which gives all edges ending at the given vertex.

### `isEdgeAtBoundary` - Defined this method which checks if the given edge is at the boundary. That is exactly one of `e` and `e.flip` is inside a face of the twocomplex.
