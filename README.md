## Superficial

Our goal is to implement various representations and algorithms for surfaces and structures on these. The implementation will be in _scala_.

## Other stuff

For the sake of convenience, this same repository was also used in the PolyMath 14 project, so there is code related to free groups and lengths on them here.
